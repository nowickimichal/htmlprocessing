# htmlprocessing
This code process html files to find medical facilities which offer medical services marked with a specific code. 
Code was implemented during my student internship in Technomex (Gliwice) and is my first  simple python project for practical use.
I was given the task of compiling a database based on the list of facilities on the website of the Ministry of Health. however, 
it turned out that the database contains the headquarters of individual entities and not the centers offering medical assistance in a given area. 
In order to find the branch to which the company wanted to send a sales representative, 
I implemented a code processing forms containing a list of all branches belonging to a given entity, 
in order to find the address of this particular entity.
It is nessesery to chose path of input and output files and the code od medical service.
Input files and output file for code 4300 can be found there:
